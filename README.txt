# aaolm.portlet.floating

This is a simple portlet that will 'stick' to the side of the screen once
the browser window has scrolled passed.  You can optionally add a DOM element 
that the portlet should not scroll passed in case you want it to stop before
it reaches the bottom of the screen.

THIS PORTLET MUST BE USED AS THE LAST PORTLET OTHERWISE IT'LL LOOK STRANGE.
