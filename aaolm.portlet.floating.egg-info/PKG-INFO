Description: # aaolm.portlet.floating
        
        This is a simple portlet that will 'stick' to the side of the screen once
        the browser window has scrolled passed.  You can optionally add a DOM element
        that the portlet should not scroll passed in case you want it to stop before
        it reaches the bottom of the screen.
